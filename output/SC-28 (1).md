 - User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server


Operators configure encryption of the identity store in the UAA. When users register an account with the Cloud Foundry platform, the UAA, acts as the user store and stores user passwords in the UAA database using bcrypt. Bcrypt is a blowfish encryption algorithm, which enables cloud foundry to store a secure hash of your users' passwords.
