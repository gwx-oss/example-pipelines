# AC-2 (3)
## Addressed by:
 - Identity and Access Management
 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
 - Access Control Policies for 18F


User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process every 30 days. 18F genereates a credential report that lists all IAM users and the status of their credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices. For passwords and access keys, the credential report shows how recently the credentials have been used. Passwords and access keys that have not been used recently will be reviewed for removal.
In addition to using credential reports, 18F also determines when a password or access key was last used by using these IAM APIs:
  - ListUsers (AWS CLI command: aws iam list-users)
  - GetUser (AWS CLI command: aws iam get-user)
  - GetAccessKeyLastUsed (AWS CLI command: aws iam get-access-key-last-used)
A manual review of all user accounts will be conducted on an annual basis.
