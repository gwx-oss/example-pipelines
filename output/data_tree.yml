            of cf-release.

            - For users, Cloud Foundry records an audit trail of all relevant API
            invocations of and app. The CLI command cf events returns this information.

            - Loggregator, the Cloud Foundry component responsible for logging, provides
            a stream of log output from 18F applications and from Cloud Foundry system
            components that interact with your app during updates and execution.

            - By default, Loggregator streams logs to a terminal. 18F will drain logs
            to a third-party log management service such as AlienVault USM and AWS
            Cloudtrail.

            - Cloud Foundry gathers and stores logs in a best-effort manner. If a
            client is unable to consume log lines quickly enough, the Loggregator
            buffer may need to overwrite some lines before the client has consumed
            them. a syslog drain or a CLI tail can usually keep up with the flow of
            application logs.
