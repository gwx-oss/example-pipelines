Cloud Foundry does not contain any guest/anonymous, group, or temporary user accounts. DevOps only creates individual user accounts and grants role based access to users within Cloud Foundry.





All Temporary accounts are handled by associating resources with IAM Roles. There are no guest/anonymous, group, or temporary user accounts in the 18F AWS environment.
